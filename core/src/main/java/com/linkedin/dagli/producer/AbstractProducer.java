  /**
   * Derived classes may override this method to determine the equality of this instance with another.  Please note
   * that if you override this method, you <strong>must</strong> override {@link #computeHashCode()}, too.
   *
   * Generally, you do not need to override this method.  Use the {@link ValueEquality}
   * or, rarely, the {@link HandleEquality} annotation to decorate your producer instead.
   *
   * <strong>This method is (theoretically) "unsafe" if your implementation's method signature specifies generic type
   * parameters for the <code>other</code> parameter.</strong>.  This is because <code>other</code>'s type
   * parameterization cannot be guaranteed and in theory this could lead to heap pollution or
   * {@link ClassCastException}s depending on your implementation (see further discussion below).
   *
   * You can easily ensure the safety of this method by simply specifying the type of the <code>other</code>
   * parameter to be the <i>concrete</i> type rather than the parameterized type.  For example, the
   * {@link com.linkedin.dagli.generator.Constant} generator uses the signature
   * {@code protected boolean computeEqualsUnsafe(Constant other)} rather than
   * {@code protected boolean computeEqualsUnsafe(Constant<R> other)}.  This prevents your implementation from making
   * a (possibly erroneous) assumption about <code>other</code>'s generic type parameterization.
   *
   * {@link com.linkedin.dagli.placeholder.Placeholder} are considered equal only if they share the same handle
   * (will behavior consistent to that provided by the {@link HandleEquality} annotation.)
   * In general, two producers may be considered equal if:
   * (1) They will always produce the same values given the same inputs to their containing DAG
   * (2) Have either the same class or one's class is a subclass of the other's
   * (3) They are "semantically equivalent", meaning their methods and fields yield equivalent results, except for
   *    {@link #getShortName()}, {@link #getName()}, {@link #toString()} and any exceptions you document on your class
   *    (the idea is that the client should not be "surprised", since Dagli may give the client a Producer that is
   *    equals() to the specific Producer they requested rather than that exact requested instance.)
   *   (3a) Also, if one's class is a superclass of the other's, only the methods/fields defined by the superclass need
   *        to be equivalent (the subclass may have additional methods/fields that the superclass lacks).
   * (4) For transformers, they have the same <strong>set</strong> of inputs (the actual arity and ordering of the lists
   *     of inputs may differ, but every input of one must equals() at least one input of the other).  Typically
   *     transformers will be more restrictive when checking for equality (like checking that the lists of inputs of
   *     both transformers have the same elements in the same order), but it is not uncommon for the inputs to be
   *     commutative (order-invariant), as they might be for a transformer that sums its inputs.
   *
   * Equality testing is what allows Dagli to optimize the DAG to eliminate redundant work.
   *
   * Implementation discussion (why make this method "unsafe"?): the reason that we type <code>other</code> with our
   * type parameter of <code>S</code> rather than the concrete class corresponding to <code>S</code> is that Java
   * provides no way to specify "concreteType(S)" as the type for <code>other</code>.  We could instead require derived
   * classes to pass both their derived concrete class and their derived generic-type-parameterized class as type
   * parameters to this class, but this would obviously be cumbersome and the relationship between the two type
   * parameters (that they correspond to the same concrete class) would be impossible to enforce.  We could also safely
   * type <code>other</code> as some known superclass or interface, such as {@link Producer}, but this leads to more
   * cumbersome implementations (the parameter value must then be cast to the concrete derived class "manually" as the
   * first line in every implementation).  Moreover, it is hard to imagine a scenario where incorrect assumptions about
   * the type parameterization of the derived class will create problems in practice: heap-pollution is possible, but
   * only if this method were modifying state, which would be abnormal for an equality test.
   *
   * Consequently, the compromise we have chosen is to allow this method to make a (theoretically unsafe) assumption
   * about <code>other</code>, but this risk is easily eliminated by simply typing <code>other</code> as
   * the derived concrete type (without generic parameterization) in the implementation's method signature.

  /**
   * Gets a type that is a supertype of all results produced by this producer.
   *
   * Dagli provides a default implementation of this method that will attempt to use reflection to find the result type,
   * but because generics are not (at present) reified in Java, the returned type is only guaranteed to be a supertype
   * of the result type, quite possibly an {@link Object}, a {@link java.lang.reflect.WildcardType}, or a
   * {@link java.lang.reflect.TypeVariable} if no more concrete, specific type can be ascertained.
   *
   * Overriding the default implementation is generally not necessary, but may be helpful in edge cases where the result
   * type is generic but the producer has some way of ascertaining that type at run-time (e.g. if it depends on the
   * input producers' result types).
   *
   * A naked type is considered to be a "supertype" of the corresponding parameterized type (e.g. {@code List}
   * is considered a valid supertype of {@code List<String>}).  Additionally, the supertype of all results may be an
   * interface, and is not strictly required to be a supertype of R (the generic type parameter that is [also] a
   * supertype of all result instances): for example, a producer that is declared to have a {@code R = Number} result
   * but knows that it will always produce {@code Double} instances can return {@code Double} from this method.
   *
