/**
 * Interface for all types of graph reducers, which optimize the graph by simplifying or rewriting it.
 *
 * The "reduction" nomenclature is used to avoid confusion with the loss optimization that may occur while a graph is
 * being prepared/trained.  Reduction occurs before the graph is executed, simplifying the graph by rewriting it (such
 * as by removing or replacing its nodes).  The resulting graph will be more efficient but maintain the same inputs and
 * outputs.
 *
 * The reduction of a DAG proceeds by repeatedly applying the available {@link Reducer}s until the graph ceases to
 * change.  No particular ordering of the application of the reducers is strictly guaranteed, but generally reductions
 * are approximately topographically ordered (i.e. the roots are reduced first) in each of one or more "passes" through
 * the graph.
 *
 * <strong>For efficiency, a "working graph" is used during the reduction of a DAG that keeps track of the producers
 * parents and children independently, such that the parents (inputs) reported by producer instances themselves are
 * irrelevant.</strong>  This means that special care must be taken when a reducer is traversing or modifying the graph:
 * (1) Methods on the {@link Context} that accept a {@link Producer} are sensitive to reference-equality; it is possible
 *     for two producers that are {@link java.util.Objects#equals(Object, Object)} to be distinct with different parents
 *     and children in the working graph.
 * (2) To get a copy of a producer with the "correct" parents (as reflected by the working graph), use
 *     {@link Context#withCurrentParents(Producer)}.
 * (3) To traverse the ancestors of a producer, use the methods provided by {@link Context}, such as
 *     {@link Context#getParents(Producer)}.
 * (4) Make sure you read and understand the description of the {@code replace(...)} methods like
 *     {@link Context#replace(PreparedTransformer, Producer)}.  If the replacement (or one of its ancestors) is not
 *     already reference-equal to an existing producer in the working graph, it will be added as a new node in the
 *     graph.
 * (5) Any method that relies on the correctness of a {@link Producer}'s ancestors will yield incorrect results relative
 *     to the conceptual state of the producer as currently situated in the working graph.  This includes
 *     {@link Producer#hasConstantResult()}, {@link Object#equals(Object)}, etc.
 *
 * Graph reducers should be immutable (i.e. their externally visible methods and fields should remain consistent once
 * they are constructed).  They may be invoked in multiple threads simultaneously.  They do not need to be serializable.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the producer being reduced (this type will usually--but does not strictly need to--derived
 *            from {@link Producer}; however, the actual instance passed to {@link #reduce(Object, Context)} will always
 *            be a producer, and hence derive from {@link Producer})
