/**
 * This is an example of a reasonably complex Dagli ML pipeline that learns a model for predicting the character (e.g.
 * Caesar, Hamlet, etc.) from a line the character utters in a Shakespearean play.
 *
 * This task is analogous to any number of simple multinomial text classification tasks such as language classification,
 * topic detection, etc.
 *
 * The goal here is to show what typical code for training a model using "off-the-shelf" components might look like, not
 * to explore, e.g. creating your own transformers (see the other examples or the documentation in
 * {@code dagli/documentation/} to learn more about this).
 *
 * If you're solving a similar problem you can use this example as a template to get started, but we suggest considering
 * simpler DAGs at first as our choice of model architecture here is pedagogical rather than practical.
 *
 * More specifically, we create a pipelined model using a combination of FastText, XGBoost and simple features.  It's
 * undoubtedly over-engineered (and overly complex) for our straightforward text classification task.
 *
 * IntelliJ users: you must have annotation processing enabled to compile this example in the IDE.  Please see
 * {@code dagli/documentation/structs.md} for instructions.

  /**
   * Trains a model, evaluates it, and (optionally) saves it.  See ShakespeareCLI (in this directory) for code that
   * loads the saved model (by default, it loads a pre-trained version out of a resource file).
   *
   * If no arguments are provided, it reads the data from the /shakespeare.tsv resource file and prints out the
   * evaluation.  Otherwise, a path to write the model to may be given as an argument.  In a real application you'd
   * read your data from a normal file (or the network) rather than a resource file, of course.
   *
   * Here's a summary of what the program will do:
   * (1) Use the Dagli-bundled DSVReader to "read" our delimiter-separated value resource file.  Technically, no data
   *     will be read until the model is being trained, and the data is streamed from disk, not fully read into RAM
   *     (this allows for training on very large datasets).
   * (2) Calls createDAG() to get the trainable model (a DAG).
   * (3) Trains the DAG.
   * (4) Evaluates the trained DAG.
   * (4) Serialized the trained DAG to disk.
   *
   * @param arguments empty array, or a single-element array with the path to which to write the model.  If this file
   *                  already exists the program will immediately terminate rather than overwrite it.

    // things.)  For reference, the configuration above yields accuracy of ~16%, and can be improved to >20% with some
    // manual hyperparameter tuning (and perhaps substantially higher; feel free to experiment!)
    //
    // However, manual hyperparameter tuning has two main drawbacks:
    // (1) It takes (human) time to run a series of experiments manually, interpret the results and then act on them.
    // (2) It's usually cheating, because people tend to use the final evaluation data as a guide; that is, they select
    //     the hyperparameters that seem to give the best numbers on a predetermined evaluation set, then report those
    //     metrics as the expected performance of the model on unseen data.  This is incorrect, because now the
    //     hyperparameters have been (manually) fit to the putatively "unseen" evaluation data and so evaluation metrics
    //     will overestimate the model's true performance.  Instead, a development set, independent of both the training
    //     and evaluation data, should be used to tune.

    // The alternative is to let Dagli tune the hyperparameter automatically using the BestModel transformer, creating
    // multiple variants of the model and letting BestModel pick the best one.
    //
    // For each candidate model, BestModel will use two or more splits, train a model corresponding to each, and then
    // produce a composite evaluation over the collective results of the models; the candidate model with the best
    // candidate evaluation is selected as the best model and is retrained on final time, with all the training data.
    //
    // For example, if we specify a split count of 3, then a candidate model will be trained three times, each time
    // using 2/3 of the available data for training and 1/3 for evaluation (the evaluation splits are disjoint such that
    // every example is used for evaluation exactly once).  The higher the split count, the more accurately the
    // performance of the model can be estimated (i.e. a model trained with 80% of data is a better approximation of
    // a model trained with 100% of the data than one trained with just 50%) but, of course, comes with a linearly
    // increasing cost in training time (and memory).
    //
    // Incidentally, DiscreteDistribution<String> is the type parameter for BestModel because our FastText model
    // produces a discrete distribution that associates a probability with some set of labels (in our case, it gives
    // a probability for each Shakespearean character name).
    //
    // If you're not sure what Java type a Dagli node produces, you can quickly check its implementation (specifically,
    // its class signature) to see what producer/placeholder/generator/transformer/view type it extends or implements.
